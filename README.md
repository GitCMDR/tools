## file-organiser.sh
Use it to organise files in subfolders depending on their extension. Script will create folders automatically naming them after the file extension. eg. script finds file.jpge in folder -> script creates 'jpge' folder -> script places file.jpge in 'jpge' folder.  


__ENSURE YOU PLACE AND RUN THE SCRIPT FROM THE FOLDER YOUR FILES ARE LOCATED.__
